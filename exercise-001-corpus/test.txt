                         THE SEVEN OLD SAMURAI

   Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their 
hiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds, 
windswept and battered by storms. The robbers lived in a large cave where they
had piled their spoils. Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a
village, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could 
lay hands on and burned it to the ground. Wherever the robbers passed, there 
was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and 
desolation.
